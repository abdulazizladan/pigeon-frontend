      <!-- Other cards kept as placeholders or removed if not needed based on new requirements. 
            Keeping them but maybe updating if data available in future. 
            For now, user just asked for Total Revenue and Charts using REPORT endpoints. 
            The other cards (Fuel Pumps, Stock, Attendants) are not covered by the new endpoints explicitly 
            unless 'station/report/daily' covers them. Assuming we keep them as is or hide them.
            I will keep them as is but maybe they will be static 0 for now until those features are connected.
