ontext: You are working on the "Pigeon" fuel station management app. The backend now exposes several new analytics and reporting endpoints to visualize sales data (trends, totals, breaking down by station).

Task: Update the ManagerDashboard and DirectorDashboard components to include visual charts and summary cards using the data from these new endpoints.

Backend Endpoints Available: Refer to 
endpoints_for_infographics.txt
 for full details. Key endpoints:

GET /sales/report/total -> { totalSale: number }
GET /sales/report/weekly -> [ { week: number, totalSale: number } ]
GET /sales/report/monthly -> [ { month: string, totalSale: number } ]
GET /station/report/daily -> Daily aggregations per station.
Requirements:

Service Integration:

Update SalesService (or create 
ReportService
) to consume the above endpoints.
Create TypeScript interfaces for the responses (see 
endpoints_for_infographics.txt
 section 4).
Dashboard UI Updates:

Summary Cards: Add cards at the top of the dashboard showing:
Total Revenue (All Time)
Total Revenue (This Month - calculate on frontend if needed or request backend endpoint)
Charts (Use chart.js or ng2-charts):
Revenue Trend (Line Chart): Use the data from /sales/report/monthly to show sales over time.
Weekly Performance (Bar Chart): Use /sales/report/weekly.
Component Structure:

Create a reusable ChartComponent or similar to handle the rendering of chart.js canvases to avoid code duplication.
Ensure charts are responsive.
Error Handling:

If the API returns an error or empty data, show a user-friendly "No Data Available" message instead of a broken chart.
Example Code Snippet (Service):

getWeeklySales(): Observable<{week: number, totalSale: number}[]> {
  return this.http.get<any[]>(`${this.apiUrl}/sales/report/weekly`);
}
Styling:

Use the existing application theme (Angular Material or Tailwind).
Ensure high contrast for chart elements.
